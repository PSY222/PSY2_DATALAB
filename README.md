# Welcome to PSY's DATALAB üòé

This is where I store project codes that I experiment for the data science competitions :)
I'm trying to experience as much data science competitions as I can to improve my skill.

The whole codes will include overall pipeline including EDA to final stage of modelling machine learning/deep learning algorithms.
I am planning to manage this repository to manage different versions of experiments for the competition.

This repository is still working in progress, so hope you understand!

HAPPY DATA EXPERIMENT ‚ù§
