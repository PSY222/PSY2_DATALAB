# Welcome to PSY's DATALAB üòé

This is where I store project codes that I experiment for the data science competitions :)
I'm trying to experience as much data science competitions as I can to improve my skill.

The codes will include overall pipeline including EDA to the final stage of modelling machine learning/deep learning algorithms. If there are any mistakes or improvements to make, feel free to pull request!
